# Reti Plugin

Plugin for interacting with the [Reti](https://reti.vote) staking protocol on Algorand.

## Contract Clients

The files in `src/contracts/` and `dist/contracts/` are auto-generated by
[@algorandfoundation/algokit-client-generator](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts).

To regenerate if Reti contracts are updated:

```bash
npx @algorandfoundation/algokit-client-generator generate -a <path-to-abi.json> -o src/contracts/
```
